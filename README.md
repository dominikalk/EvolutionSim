# EvolutionSim
A simple evolution simulator made with unity

If you are would like to see the most complicated scripts go into Assets/Scripts and look at **Animal.cs** or **TerrainGenerator.cs**

This was made for my A Level course work. You can look at the game page on https://dominikalk.itch.io/evosim
