# EvolutionSim

### Game page - https://dominikalk.itch.io/evosim

An evolution simulator made for my A Level course work. 

Edit the properties, generate the terrain and enjoy! Lets see what happens ...

The terrain is procedurally generated, watch this affect the animals' populations. The pause menu contains a graph of the varying populations and a genetic trait of your choice. Monitor how the species' evolve to survive.

You can find the terrain generation file in `./Assets/Scripts/TerrainGenerator.cs`, which is the file that includes the most math and algorithms.

To try out the simulator you do no need Unity installed, you can either clone this repo and run the `./Standalone/EvoSim.exe` file, or you can look at the game page on https://dominikalk.itch.io/evosim and download the zip from there.
